### Testing with Multiple Browsers and platforms

* Try to test with a diverse selection of client platforms and client browsers.
* If you have a Desktop/Laptop, please test with Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.
  * _Any `chromium` based browser counts towards Chrome, such as: Brave, MS Edge, Google Chrome, or Opera._
* If you have a smart phone, please test with the built-in browser, Chrome, and Firefox.
  * _Dolphin Browser is an edge case and testing does not need to include the Dolphin browser._


### Current Known Issues:

* Can not add more than one card to a deck.
* When clicking on the `Publish` button, it changes the name of the deck to `Un-named Deck`.
* Clicking the `Unpublish` button has no effect.
